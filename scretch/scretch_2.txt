Hitting the end goal exactly with an RRT is proving troublesome. 

The termination condition is based on a radius to the goal, which means that the algorithm will terminate when a node is added to the tree that is within a certain distance (i.e. radius) of the goal configuration.

More often than not, this will produce final segments which do not quite reach the goal configuration.

This is not ideal. Let's try to fix this.

One thing we could try is to instantiate a bunch of segments connected to the goal. We would then need to modify the feasibility check
